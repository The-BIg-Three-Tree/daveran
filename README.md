# DAVERAN

The goal of the DAVERAN project is to create an application that recognises prebaked handsigns and  show the user their meaning. The application will store the recognised symbols in a sequence, which will make the constuction of sentences possible.

The project uses TensorFlow Lite for the machine learning in the backend, and Flutter for the UI in the frontend.

The target platform of the project is Android, but it's possible, that in the future more platforms will be supported.
